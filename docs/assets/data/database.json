            "beskrivelse": "Marantz developed its own discrete circuit boards to replace standard ICs. These HDAMs consist of discrete surface mount components with short mirror image L/R signal paths. These devices do exactly the same thing as the widely used Op-Amps but outperform these designs dramatically in terms of the Slew Rate and reduced noise level, resulting in more dynamic, accurate and detailed sound. In the CD6007, the proprietary HDAM-SA2 circuit improves on its previous HDAM module for an even more stable power supply. The idling current stability is less influenced by power transistor temperatures to maintain sound performance even at high level output.",

It is light, comfortable and built on the same features as the SR60e headphone. However the SR80e utilises a 4 conductor connecting cable and the driver diaphragms are put through a special 'de-stressing' process in order to enhance inner detail. The result is a headset which delivers a wider, more open and dynamic soundstage, but which is also smoother in the treble and deeper and even better controlled in the bass; a sound that is pure Grado.",

The Artera Stereo produces 140 Watts RMS per channel – ample power for driving first-class loudspeakers, unfaltering even under high dynamic and transient conditions thanks to the patented Current Dumping technology. Special attention has also been paid to the newly developed balanced XLR inputs. The robust connections are yet another string to the Artera Stereo's bow, with an incomparable signal to noise ratio.",
