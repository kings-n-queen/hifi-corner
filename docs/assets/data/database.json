These HDAMs consist of discrete surface mount components with short mirror image L/R signal paths. These devices do exactly the same thing as the widely used Op-Amps but outperform these designs dramatically in terms of the Slew Rate and reduced noise level, resulting in more dynamic, accurate and detailed sound. In the CD6007, the proprietary HDAM-SA2 circuit improves on its previous HDAM module for an even more stable power supply. The idling current stability is less influenced by power transistor temperatures to maintain sound performance even at high level output.",

                "beskrivelse": "FBA-800 is our most advanced power amplifier. The floating bridge design combines four 20 Watt amplifiers in a single stereo chassis and provides several key benefits. Each channel consists of two amplifiers working as voltage amplifiers driving an output stage of bridged power transistors. The advantages are a low noise floor, better power output relative to the voltage rails (x2) and with the fixed current of the class A mode, low output impedance and better load tolerance.",

But, also for people who want to combine it with other preamps, the REVO PA-160MR can become a perfect partner. For example, with the best tube preamps you can enhance the characteristics of sound, giving an extraordinary ability to drive the speakers without introducing any harshness in the sound and the listening fatigue often present in solid state amplifiers.",
