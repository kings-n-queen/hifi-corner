            "beskrivelse": "Creek Classic Evo Hi-Fi Turntable. The new Classic Evo is based on the successful EISA Award winner Creek The Classic. The main improvement is the sub-platter, where we used the experience we gained from designing the 175 – Vienna Philharmonic Recordplayer to add key changes to the Classic Evo. The main bearing construction we use is a similar system as the one on the Vienna Philharmonic Recordplayer. For improved comfort, an electronic speed change was built in, which lets you switch from 33 to 45 rpm (and vice versa) with the push of a button. Compared to the old Classic, we improved the subchassis; we tried to make it heavier and stiffer to reduce resonances. Isolating the platter and tonearm from the resonances of the motor and main plinth is the target. The heavy aluminium main platter construction utilises advanced thermo plastic elastomers (TPE) for optimising resonance behaviour.",

The CD Box RS is an elegant device that uses a stylish functional top-loading gravity design and a convenient magnetic clamp. Additional weight at the bottom of the casing draws unwanted vibrations away from the playing surface, while advanced suspension system allows for a playing disc to spin true. Connection to external sources is achieved either by S/PDIF coax, optical or AES/EBU. Alternatively, for perfect matching with the DAC Box RS or Pre Box RS Digital, an innovative RJ45 I2S/Master Clock connection option is also available.",

            "beskrivelse": "When you sail a yacht in open sea, you trust the GPS to determine your location. The biggest part of a sailing experience exists of pure analog operations; from hoisting the sails to changing course. To take a nap in the cabin or cook a nice meal in the yachts kitchen, you don't need any digital support. When adjusting the heading or entering a new course, the digital power is put to work. The digital support guarantees the best analog experience. Just like with our SCD-025 mk.II. Although this CD / DAC is packed with digital top-notch technology, it offers the best analog sound out there! You're steering right into the direction of the Signature CD / DAC (SCD-025 mk. II). All the seawater flows to the endless musical ocean of Vitus Audio… How could we create such a fine piece of equipment with a true analog sound? We used our primary analog turntable along with a Masterpiece Phono Stage as preamplifier for reference. The desire was to simply make the SCD-025 mk.II a much more musical machine that anything else on the market. Choosing for the SCD-025 mk.II ensures you of a lifetime investment. The unit is a modular design, so it's future proof. The predecessor of the SCD-025 mk.II didn't have a USB input, so we went for a new design to convince enthusiasts even more. Worthy of the name Signature Series you get a lot more then just the USB interface. The SCD-025 mk.II was designed as a DAC with a drive, which gives the user the flexibility of adding other digital sources directly to the unit. Integration, balance, performance. Three words that best describe the essence of the SCD-025 mk.II CD / DAC. Only available in dedicated high end shops.",

The Artera Stereo produces 140 Watts RMS per channel – ample power for driving first-class loudspeakers, unfaltering even under high dynamic and transient conditions thanks to the patented Current Dumping technology. Special attention has also been paid to the newly developed balanced XLR inputs. The robust connections are yet another string to the Artera Stereo's bow, with an incomparable signal to noise ratio.",
